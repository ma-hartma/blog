# Hello World!
I am a software engineer with passion for sofware architecture.

You can see the projects I am currently working on on the [projects page](../projects).

I see programming languages as a tool. I've already worked with dotnet, golang, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, PHP, HTML and CSS. The most of them are object oriented and I've mostly used them in the context of full stack web development. I also work on a commandline tool.

I study Computer Science in the 5. semester at [Augsburg University of Applied Sciences](https://hs-augsburg.de).

I currently work for following companies:
- LEW Service & Consulting GmbH (Working Student)
- EasyBenefit UG(Haftungsbeschränkt) (Co-Founder)
- Augsburg University Of Applied Sciences (Tutor Software Engineering)
- Timeleon UG(Haftungsbeschränkt) (Currently founding)

In my freetime I enjoy
- Sailing (currently working on my license)
- Hiking
- Reading
